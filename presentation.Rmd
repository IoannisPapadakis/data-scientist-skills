## Motivation

Our motivation for this study is to gain an understanding of which skills are the most useful for a data scientist to have so that we can plan what courses to take in our Master's program.

## Approach

To answer this question we will scrape data scientist job listings on dice.com and extract the skills listed on the postings.

## Findings

### What are the Key Skills?
```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=10, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(wordcloud)

data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikeasilva/data-scientist-skills/master/ds%20skills%20-%20cleaning%20-%20categorized_skills.csv", header = TRUE) %>%
  filter(clean_skill != "Exclude") %>%
  filter(skill_group != "Position") %>%
  group_by(clean_skill, Period.Table.Group) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(count)) %>%
  arrange(-count) %>%
  ungroup()

set.seed(2)

wordcloud(words = data$clean_skill, freq = data$count, scale=c(8,.5),
          min.freq = 2, max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0, 
          colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
```
